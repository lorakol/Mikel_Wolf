Instructions:  Media Player - The MediaPlayer object in the app should be placed in a service and play several songs in sequence out of the raw resources directory. When one song completes playback, it should automatically move on to the next song. When you're done using the Media Player be sure to release all resources associated with the player. Service -  we should use a bound service to support operations through a service binder. The service should also be responsible for handling the notifications. Notification - A notification should be shown that shows the currently playing song and album art. Keep in mind the proper expanded layout style for showing a large image of album art. Actions can be used to add basic skipping controls to the notification and, as with any notification, be sure to make the notification open the app when clicked. UI - The app UI should show controls for playing, pausing, and stopping audio playback as well as skipping forward and backwards to the next or previous song. Toggle controls (such as a ToggleButton, CheckBox, or Switch) should be used to turn looping and shuffling on or off. A seekbar will show and control playback progress. This control won't update on its own, so you have to come up with a system for doing that. Also plan for both orientations as changing rotation is a requirement of the assignment. The song titles and album art can either be set in code per song, or the album art and song title can be accessed directly through the audio file's metadata.
