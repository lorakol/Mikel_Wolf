Application should show a single GridView that displays data in two columns.
Grid items should show titles of books and an image of the book.
Images displayed on grid items should come from the Google Books API and should be displayed with the help of a library such as SmartImageView or Picasso.
Networking:

Application should pull down data from the Google Books API using a URLConnection or appropriate subclass.
Application should utilize a stream reading library, such as the Apache commons-io library, to pull data from the connection's InputStream.
NOTE: Use the “jar” version of the lib instead of Maven*.
URLConnection and InputStream used to pull down data should be properly closed and disconnected when finished.
Retrieved data should be parsed using the built-in JSON classes and converted into custom objects that hold only the required data.
The network state should be checked before any connections are made. Make sure to test the application by putting the device into airplane mode.
AsyncTask:

An AsyncTask should be used to facilitate the retrieval of data from the Google Books API.
The appropriate AsyncTask callback should be used to show an indeterminate ProgressBar before the task begins background operations.
The appropriate AsyncTask method should be used to pull down data from the Google Books API on a background thread.
The appropriate AsyncTask callback should be used to hide the shown ProgressBar when the task completes background operations.
The appropriate AsyncTask callback should be used to update the UI with the retrieved data after the task finishes execution.
