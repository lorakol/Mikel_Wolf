Android Digging game

this will be an android â€œdigging" game. Canvas Drawing - Application will contain a custom SurfaceView control that allows for the drawing of a game board. The game board will consist of a ground texture that fills the entire screen and some text at the top of the screen to show how many pieces of treasure are hidden underground. When the user selects a location, the dirt hole texture should show at that location to indicate that the user dug a hole there already. Items and Digging - Application will pull data from a CSV file containing pairs of items and values. At the start of the game, the items will be assigned random positions on the game board. When the user taps on the game board at a given location, all items within a certain radius of the tap are considered found. All found items should show as a toast and be visible in the inventory. Each item should only be able to be found once. App Functionality - Application will start on a menu screen with two buttons for starting the game or viewing the credits. Credits screen should at least contain the student's name (Mike Salinas)  and credit for the art (Art by Full Sail University). Selecting the "start game" option will take the user to the game board screen. Selecting an ActionBar menu item from game board screen will take the user to the inventory where they can see all of the items they've collected and how much gold they have.
