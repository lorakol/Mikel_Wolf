weather widget: A single widget should appear on the home screen and be four cells wide by one cell tall. The left side of the widget should show a weather icon that matches weather data for the selected city. The middle of the widget should show current weather conditions, current temperature, and the most recent data timestamp for the selected city. The right side of the widget should show a button to open up the configuration activity. Widget should fill out with cached data if available. 

widget configuration: Widget should be setup to contain a configuration activity that launches when the widget is added to the home screen. Configuration activity should show a single PreferenceFragment with two list preferences for selecting from a light or dark theme and for selecting from one of three cities to view weather data. Widget should change in appearance based on the selected theme and currently selected city when the configuration is saved. 

Service: Application should contain a single IntentService, JobIntentService, Worker, or background thread for pulling down weather data for the currently selected city when the configuration is saved or when the widget has reached its update interval. Data should be saved out to a file to be used as cached data later on. 

Forecast Activity: Clicking on the weather icon of the widget should open a forecast activity that shows the forecast for the next three days. Forecast data should consist of, at a minimum, the weather icon and high and low temperatures. Data can be pulled with an AsyncTask for this activity instead of using a service if desired.
