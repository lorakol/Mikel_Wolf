Google Maps and Location: App should show a map upon launch and zoom into the user's current location. Best practices should be followed when accessing location data to ensure as little strain on the battery as possible. When data is saved on the form screen, that data should be associated with a lat/long location and a marker should be placed on the map to represent that data. Selecting that marker should show a custom info window with a summary of the data at that location and clicking on the info window should take the user to a details view showing a complete breakdown of the selected data. Camera and Images :  App should be able to open the camera from the form page via a click to an ActionBar item. The application should pass in a storage location in order to save a full size image in a custom location. Images taken in the app should be displayed on the form and details pages. Storage: Records stored in the app should persist between launches and contain all data required in order to fully display everything entered in the form. It is also acceptable to store the two strings and the GPS coordinates in the meta data of the image file to avoid needing a custom object that is saved separately from the image file. UI: The application will contain three screens: map, form, and detail. The map screen should show a map, the form screen should allow the user to enter data and take a picture, and the details page should show a summary of the selected data from the map.
